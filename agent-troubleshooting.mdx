## When the AI Hallucinates

Occasionally, the AI may generate output that is incorrect, incomplete, or not grounded in your actual project state. This is referred to as **hallucination**.

Hallucinations usually appear as:

- Referencing files, APIs, or features that don't exist
- Claiming something was "fixed" when nothing changed
- Repeating solutions that don't resolve the issue
- Providing confident but incorrect instructions

This is expected behavior in AI systems and does not indicate a broken project.

## How to Resolve Hallucinations

### 1. Ground the Model With Facts

Provide **real, concrete inputs**:

- Error logs
- File contents
- Build output
- Exact error messages

<Warning>
Avoid vague prompts like "It's broken, fix it."
</Warning>

Instead use:

> "Here is the full error output. Fix only what's causing this error."

### 2. Constrain the Scope

Tell the AI **exactly what it can and cannot change**.

Examples:

- "Only modify the home screen component."
- "Do not add new libraries."
- "Do not change the navigation structure."

Clear constraints reduce hallucination significantly.

### 3. Force Verification

If the AI claims something is fixed, require confirmation.

Use prompts like:

- "Show me exactly what changed."
- "Which file was modified and why?"
- "Quote the line that fixes the error."

If it cannot point to a real change, assume the fix is invalid.

### 4. Reset the Context

If hallucinations persist:

- Start a **new message** with fresh context
- Paste only the **relevant files or logs**
- Restate the goal clearly

Long conversations increase the chance of drift. Sometimes starting fresh is the fastest path forward.

### 5. Use Images for Clarity

If the issue is visual, **attach a screenshot** to your prompt:

> "This button should be blue, but it's showing as red. See the attached screenshot."

Visual context helps the AI understand exactly what needs to change.

## When to Stop Iterating

Stop prompting the AI if:

- It repeats the same fix multiple times
- It references non-existent files
- It contradicts itself across responses

At that point, consider:

- Starting a new conversation
- Simplifying your request
- Breaking the problem into smaller pieces

## Best Practices to Avoid Loops

<AccordionGroup>
  <Accordion icon="file-code" title="Always paste real logs">
    Copy the actual error message or log output into your prompt. Don't paraphrase — the exact text matters.
  </Accordion>
  <Accordion icon="bullseye" title="Keep prompts short and specific">
    Focus on one issue at a time. Multi-part prompts are more likely to cause confusion.
  </Accordion>
  <Accordion icon="check" title="Verify every claimed fix">
    After the AI says something is fixed, test it. Don't assume the fix worked until you see it in the preview.
  </Accordion>
  <Accordion icon="scale-balanced" title="Treat AI output as a suggestion">
    The AI is a powerful tool, but it's not infallible. Use your judgment to evaluate its suggestions.
  </Accordion>
</AccordionGroup>

## Key Principle

<Info>
The AI is strongest when reacting to **real inputs**, not guessing missing context.
</Info>

Hallucinations are a signal that the AI needs **more constraints or better grounding**, not that your app is broken. Provide clearer context and try again.
