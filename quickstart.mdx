## Get started in three steps

Create your first mobile app with MobileCoder's AI-powered development platform.

<Steps>
<Step title="Create an Account">

Visit [mobilecoder.dev](https://mobilecoder.dev) and sign up for a free account. You can use your email or sign in with GitHub.

</Step>

<Step title="Start a New Project">

Click **New Project** and give your app a name. MobileCoder will set up a new React Native project for you automatically.

</Step>

<Step title="Describe Your App">

Tell the AI what you want to build. For example:

```text
Create a todo app with a list of tasks. Each task should have a title, 
a checkbox to mark it complete, and a delete button. Add a text input 
at the top to add new tasks.
```

The AI will generate the code and you'll see your app appear in the live preview.

</Step>
</Steps>

## Tips for Better Results

<AccordionGroup>
  <Accordion icon="lightbulb" title="Be specific about UI elements">
    Instead of "make it look nice", describe specific styling like "use a blue header with white text" or "add rounded corners to the buttons".
  </Accordion>
  <Accordion icon="list" title="Break down complex features">
    For complex apps, describe one feature at a time. Start with the basic structure, then add features incrementally.
  </Accordion>
  <Accordion icon="arrows-rotate" title="Iterate and refine">
    After the AI generates code, you can ask it to make changes. Say things like "make the buttons larger" or "add a loading spinner".
