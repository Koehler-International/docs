## When to Use Voice vs Text

**Use voice input when:**

- Describing complex UX flows conversationally
- You think faster than you type
- Doing hands-free development
- Brainstorming ideas quickly

**Use text input when:**

- You need precise technical terms
- Copying code snippets or error messages
- Making small, specific edits
- Working in a noisy environment

## Example Voice Prompts

Here are some examples of effective voice prompts:

> "Create a profile screen with the user's avatar at the top, their name and bio below that, and a list of their recent posts. Make it feel modern and clean."

> "Add a settings page with toggles for notifications, dark mode, and a logout button at the bottom. Use the same styling as the rest of the app."

> "The login screen has a bug — when I tap the submit button, nothing happens. Can you add some loading state and error handling?"
