## How Live Preview Works

MobileCoder provides a **live preview** of your app that updates in real-time as the AI builds your code. You can test your app directly in the browser or on your physical device.

The preview runs in a cloud sandbox powered by Expo, giving you an authentic mobile experience without needing to install any development tools locally.

## Testing in the Browser

The browser preview shows your app in a simulated phone frame. This is the fastest way to see changes and test basic functionality.

**Browser preview is great for:**

- Quick visual checks
- Testing navigation flows
- Verifying layout and styling
- Rapid iteration

<Info>
Some native features may not work in the browser preview. For the most accurate testing, use the Expo Go app on your physical device.

## Testing on Your Device with Expo Go

For the most accurate testing experience, scan the QR code to open your app in **Expo Go** on your phone.

<Steps>
<Step title="Install Expo Go">

Download the Expo Go app from the [App Store](https://apps.apple.com/app/expo-go/id982107779) (iOS) or [Google Play](https://play.google.com/store/apps/details?id=host.exp.exponent) (Android).

</Step>

<Step title="Scan the QR Code">

In MobileCoder, click the **QR code** icon in the preview panel. Use your phone's camera (iOS) or the Expo Go app (Android) to scan the code.

</Step>

<Step title="Test Your App">

Your app will open in Expo Go with full native functionality. Changes made in MobileCoder will automatically refresh in the app.

</Step>

## Preview States

The preview panel shows the current state of your sandbox:

| State | Description |
|-------|-------------|
| **Idle** | No preview active. Start building to see the preview. |
| **Starting** | The sandbox is initializing. This usually takes a few seconds. |
| **Ready** | Your app is running and ready to test. |
| **Paused** | The sandbox has been paused due to inactivity. It will auto-resume when you return. |
| **Agent Running** | The AI is actively working on your code. The preview will update when complete. |

## Sandbox Expiration and Auto-Resume

To save resources, MobileCoder **pauses sandboxes** after a period of inactivity (typically 20 minutes). When you return to your project:

1. The sandbox will automatically resume
2. Your code is restored from the saved state
3. The preview will be available again in a few seconds

<Note>
Your code is automatically saved to GitHub, so you never lose your work even if the sandbox expires.
</Note>

## Preview Limitations

While the live preview is powerful, there are some limitations to be aware of:

- **Native modules**: Some native iOS/Android features may not work in the browser preview
- **Push notifications**: Require a physical device and proper setup
- **Camera/sensors**: Hardware features require a physical device
- **Performance**: The browser preview may be slower than a native build

For production testing, we recommend [exporting your code](/publishing/code-export) and building a native app.

## Troubleshooting

<AccordionGroup>
  <Accordion icon="circle-exclamation" title="Preview not loading">
    Try refreshing the page or clicking the restart button in the preview panel. If the issue persists, check if the AI is still working on your code.
  </Accordion>
  <Accordion icon="qrcode" title="QR code not scanning">
    Make sure you have Expo Go installed. On iOS, use the native camera app. On Android, use the Expo Go app's scanner.
  </Accordion>
  <Accordion icon="clock" title="Preview shows 'Paused'">
    Click anywhere in the preview panel or send a new message to resume your sandbox.
  </Accordion>
