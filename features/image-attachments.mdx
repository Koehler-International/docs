## Overview

MobileCoder allows you to **attach images** to your prompts, giving the AI visual context for what you want to build. This is incredibly useful for sharing design mockups, providing UI inspiration, or showing bugs that need fixing.

## How to Attach Images

There are three ways to attach images to your prompts:

### Drag and Drop

Simply drag an image file from your computer and drop it into the chat input area.

### Paste from Clipboard

Copy an image to your clipboard (e.g., screenshot), then paste it directly into the chat input with `Cmd+V` (Mac) or `Ctrl+V` (Windows).

### File Picker

Click the **attachment icon** in the chat input to open a file picker and select images from your computer.

## Supported Formats

MobileCoder supports the following image formats:

| Format | Extension |
|--------|-----------|
| JPEG | `.jpg`, `.jpeg` |
| PNG | `.png` |
| GIF | `.gif` |
| WebP | `.webp` |
| SVG | `.svg` |

<Warning>
Images must be under **5MB** in size. Larger images will need to be compressed before uploading.
</Warning>

## Use Cases

### UI Mockups and Wireframes

Upload a design mockup or wireframe to show MobileCoder exactly what you want to build:

> "Build this screen based on the attached mockup. Match the layout and styling as closely as possible."

### Design Inspiration

Share a screenshot of an app you admire:

> "I like the card design in this screenshot. Can you update our product list to use a similar style?"

### Bug Reports

Attach a screenshot showing a visual bug:

> "The button is overlapping the text as shown in this screenshot. Can you fix the layout?"

### Brand Assets

Upload logos, icons, or brand colors:

> "Here's our company logo. Please add it to the header and make sure it's properly sized."

## Multiple Images

You can attach **multiple images** to a single prompt. This is useful when:

- Showing different screens for context
- Providing before/after comparisons
- Sharing multiple design references

## Tips for Better Results

<AccordionGroup>
  <Accordion icon="crop" title="Use clear, focused images">
    Crop images to show only the relevant part. Full screenshots with lots of irrelevant content can be distracting.
  </Accordion>
  <Accordion icon="arrows-maximize" title="Use appropriate resolution">
    High-resolution images work best. Blurry or low-quality images may be harder for the AI to interpret.
  </Accordion>
  <Accordion icon="message" title="Describe what you want">
    Don't just attach an image — explain what you want MobileCoder to do with it. Be specific about which elements to replicate.
  </Accordion>
  <Accordion icon="palette" title="Reference specific elements">
    Point out specific parts of the image: "I like the rounded corners on the buttons" or "Match the color scheme in this design."
  </Accordion>
</AccordionGroup>

## Example Prompts with Images

**With a mockup:**
> "Build this onboarding flow. There are 3 screens — an intro, a feature highlight, and a signup form. Follow the attached designs."

**With a screenshot:**
> "See the attached screenshot — there's too much spacing between the cards. Can you reduce the gap to make it more compact?"

**With inspiration:**
> "I attached a screenshot from the Spotify app. I really like their dark theme with green accents. Apply a similar color scheme to our app."
