title: "Do You Need a Backend?"
description: "Learn when your app requires a backend and when you can skip it entirely"

## Overview

MobileCoder helps you build beautiful mobile applications. But not every app needs a backend. This guide helps you understand when you need server-side functionality and when you can keep things simple.

**Frontend** = The user-facing parts of your app (screens, buttons, interactions)

**Backend** = Server-side functionality (user accounts, data sync, file storage)

By the end of this guide, you'll know exactly which category your idea falls into.

## Apps That Don't Need a Backend

### 1. Local-Only Apps

These apps store all data on the user's device. No sync needed. No logins required.

**Examples:**

- Todo lists
- Notes apps
- Journals
- Habit trackers
- Mood logs
- Calculators
- Timers
- Unit converters
- Offline flashcards

MobileCoder can build all of these with **no backend at all**, using local storage that persists on the device.

<Info>
If your app isn't saving data locally, just ask MobileCoder: **"Please make sure the data is being stored locally and persists."**
</Info>

### 2. Apps With Temporary Data

Apps that don't need to remember anything after they close.

**Examples:**

- Drawing apps
- Mini-games
- AI generators (without history)
- Fun tools that create something but don't save it

If nothing needs to persist after the app closes, no backend is needed.

### 3. Apps That Only Call External APIs

If your app just sends requests to external services (like OpenAI, weather APIs, etc.) and displays the results:

**You do not need a backend.**

You're just making API requests directly from the app.

Backend becomes optional only when:

- You want to save user history
- You want personalization
- You want usage tracking

## Apps That Always Need a Backend

### 1. Apps With User Accounts

If users "have an account," you need:

- Authentication
- Storing user data
- Syncing across devices

**Examples:**

- Social apps
- Productivity apps with cloud sync
- Finance apps
- Any multi-device workflow

### 2. Apps That Sync Across Devices

A user writes a note on their phone and expects it on their tablet. That requires:

- A database
- Cloud sync
- Persistent server-side storage

### 3. Apps With Sharing or Collaboration

If more than one person can see, edit, or interact with the same data:

- Messaging
- Social feeds
- Comments
- Real-time collaboration
- Multiplayer features

All of this needs a backend.

### 4. Apps That Store Files

If your app handles user-uploaded files (images, videos, PDFs) and these need to persist across devices, you need cloud storage.

Local storage won't work for sharable content.

### 5. Apps With Security Rules

If the app enforces rules between users:

- Blocking
- Moderation
- Rate limiting
- Access control

Client-only apps can't enforce security rules. A backend is required.

## Gray-Zone Apps (Optional Backend)

### Local-First Apps With Optional Sync

Some apps work great without a backend initially, then add cloud features later.

**Examples:**

- Journal → adds cloud backup later
- Notes app → adds multi-device sync later
- Photo editor → adds sharing later

You can ship v1 with no backend and add sync when you're ready.

### AI Apps With Memory

You can choose:

- **Local-only memory** → no backend
- **Cloud memory across devices** → backend
- **Personalized AI** → backend

Start simple with local storage; add cloud features when you have users.

## Good News: MobileCoder Makes Backends Easy

If you do need a backend, MobileCoder has **native Supabase integration** that makes it incredibly simple.

Unlike manual setups that require configuring API keys and writing boilerplate code, MobileCoder lets you:

- Connect your Supabase project with one click (OAuth)
- Manage your database directly in MobileCoder
- Let the AI automatically design schemas for your features
- Handle authentication without complex setup
