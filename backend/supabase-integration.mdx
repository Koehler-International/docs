## Overview

MobileCoder has **native Supabase integration** that makes adding a backend to your app incredibly simple. Unlike manual setups, you can connect your Supabase project with OAuth — no API keys to copy, no configuration files to edit.

Once connected, MobileCoder's AI can:

- Create database tables and schemas
- Set up authentication flows
- Design Row Level Security policies
- Manage storage buckets
- Write all the backend code for you

## What is Supabase?

[Supabase](https://supabase.com) is an open-source backend platform that provides:

- **Database**: PostgreSQL database for storing your app data
- **Auth**: User authentication with email, social logins, and more
- **Storage**: File storage for images, videos, and documents
- **Edge Functions**: Serverless functions for custom logic

## Connecting Supabase to MobileCoder

<Steps>
<Step title="Create a Supabase Account">

If you don't have one, go to [supabase.com](https://supabase.com) and create a free account.

</Step>

<Step title="Create a New Project">

In Supabase, create a new project. Choose a name, region (closest to your users), and set a database password.

</Step>

<Step title="Connect via OAuth">

In MobileCoder, open the **Supabase Manager** panel and click **Connect Supabase**. You'll be redirected to Supabase to authorize the connection.

</Step>

<Step title="Select Your Project">

After authorizing, select which Supabase project you want to connect to your MobileCoder project.

</Step>
</Steps>

<Info>
The OAuth connection is secure — MobileCoder never sees your Supabase password. Tokens are encrypted and automatically refresh.

## Using the Supabase Manager

Once connected, you can access the **Supabase Manager** directly in MobileCoder:

### Database Tables

View and browse your database tables. See the structure, columns, and data types at a glance.

### SQL Editor

Execute SQL queries directly from MobileCoder. Great for:

- Viewing data
- Running custom queries
- Debugging issues

### Users Management

View and manage authenticated users in your app.

### Storage Browser

Browse files in your Supabase Storage buckets.

### Secrets

Manage environment variables and secrets securely.

## How the AI Uses Supabase

When Supabase is connected, MobileCoder's AI automatically knows about your database and can:

### Design Database Schemas

> "Add a feature to save user favorites. Users should be able to favorite any product."

The AI will create the necessary tables, columns, and relationships.

### Create Row Level Security

The AI sets up proper security policies so users can only access their own data.

### Handle Authentication

> "Add login with email and password."

The AI will implement the full auth flow using Supabase Auth.

### Store Files

> "Let users upload a profile picture."

The AI will configure storage buckets and handle file uploads.

## Example: Building a Social App

Here's how a conversation might go:

**You:** "Create a social app where users can post updates and follow other users."

**MobileCoder:** Creates the UI and asks if you want to connect Supabase.

**You:** Connect Supabase via OAuth.

**MobileCoder:** Creates tables for users, posts, and follows. Sets up authentication. Implements the follow/unfollow logic with proper RLS policies.

All of this happens automatically because MobileCoder understands your Supabase project.

## Disconnecting Supabase

If you need to disconnect or switch to a different Supabase project:

1. Open the Supabase Manager
2. Click the settings/disconnect option
3. Confirm the disconnection

You can reconnect at any time with a different project.

## Troubleshooting

<AccordionGroup>
  <Accordion icon="link-slash" title="Connection failed">
    Make sure you're logged into Supabase and have at least one project. Try disconnecting and reconnecting.
  </Accordion>
  <Accordion icon="clock" title="Changes not appearing">
    The Supabase Manager may need to refresh. Click the refresh button or wait a few seconds for data to sync.
  </Accordion>
  <Accordion icon="lock" title="Permission errors">
    Check that your Supabase project's Row Level Security policies allow the operations you're trying to perform.
