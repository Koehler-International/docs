## Overview

MobileCoder automatically saves your project code to **GitHub** after every AI execution. This ensures your work is always backed up and ready to export when you need it.

## How It Works

When you create a project in MobileCoder, a private GitHub repository is automatically created for you. Here's what happens:

1. **Automatic saves**: After each AI execution, your code is pushed to GitHub
2. **Code restoration**: If your sandbox expires, code is restored from GitHub when you return
3. **Always backed up**: Your work is never lost, even if you close the browser

<Info>
You don't need to do anything to enable GitHub sync — it works automatically for all projects.

## Benefits of GitHub Integration

### Never Lose Your Work

Sandboxes automatically pause after inactivity. When you return, your code is restored from GitHub exactly as you left it.

### Easy Code Export

Download your complete project as a ZIP file or clone it directly from GitHub. Your code is always accessible.

### Professional Workflow

Take your project beyond MobileCoder:

- Open it in **VS Code** or **Cursor**
- Run and debug in **Xcode**
- Hand it off to a developer
- Continue development independently

## Downloading Your Code

### Option 1: Download as ZIP

1. Open your project in MobileCoder
2. Click the **Download** button in the header
3. Your complete project will download as a ZIP file

### Option 2: Clone from GitHub

If you have the repository URL, you can clone it directly:

```bash
git clone https://github.com/your-org/your-project.git
```

## What's Included

Your downloaded project includes everything you need:

- All React Native/Expo source code
- `package.json` with dependencies
- App configuration files
- Assets (images, fonts)
- Navigation structure
- Any connected integrations

## Working With Your Exported Code

Once you've downloaded your code, you can:

### Run Locally

```bash
# Install dependencies
npm install

# Start the development server
npx expo start
```

### Open in Xcode

```bash
# Generate native iOS project
npx expo prebuild -p ios

# Open in Xcode
xed ios
```

See our [Xcode Setup Guide](/publishing/xcode-setup) for detailed instructions.

### Continue Development

Edit your code in any IDE (VS Code, Cursor, etc.) and continue building with full control.

## Code Restoration

When your sandbox expires and you return to your project:

1. MobileCoder detects the sandbox needs restoration
2. Your code is automatically pulled from GitHub
3. The sandbox is recreated with your latest code
4. The preview becomes available again

This usually takes just a few seconds.

## Troubleshooting

    Make sure your project has been built at least once. If the issue persists, try refreshing the page.

  <Accordion icon="clock" title="Code seems outdated">
    Code is saved after each AI execution. If you made changes and the AI hasn't run yet, those changes might not be saved.

  <Accordion icon="rotate" title="Restoration taking too long">
    Large projects may take a bit longer to restore. Wait a few moments and the preview should appear.
