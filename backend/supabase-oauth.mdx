## Overview

Adding social sign-in (Apple, Google) to your app provides a seamless authentication experience for users. This guide walks you through setting up OAuth providers with Supabase and integrating them into your MobileCoder app.

<Warning>
Before starting, make sure you've [connected Supabase](/backend/supabase-integration) to your MobileCoder project.
</Warning>

## Prerequisites

You'll need:

- A connected **Supabase project**
- Access to **Google Cloud Console** (for Google OAuth)
- An **Apple Developer account** (for Sign in with Apple)

---

## Setting Up Google Sign-In

### Step 1: Create Google OAuth Credentials

<Steps>
<Step title="Open Google Cloud Console">

Go to [Google Cloud Console](https://console.cloud.google.com/) and select or create a project.

</Step>

<Step title="Create OAuth Client">

Navigate to **APIs & Services → Credentials → Create Credentials → OAuth Client ID**.

Choose **Web application** as the application type.

</Step>

<Step title="Configure Redirect URI">

In Supabase, go to **Authentication → Providers → Google** and copy the **Callback URL**.

Add this URL to the **Authorized redirect URIs** in Google Cloud Console.

</Step>

<Step title="Copy Credentials">

Copy the **Client ID** and **Client Secret** from Google Cloud Console.

</Step>
</Steps>

### Step 2: Configure Supabase

1. In Supabase, go to **Authentication → Providers → Google**
2. Enable the Google provider
3. Paste your **Client ID** and **Client Secret**
4. Save the configuration

### Step 3: Add to Your App

In MobileCoder, prompt:

> "Add Google sign-in to the app using Supabase Auth."

The AI will implement the complete Google OAuth flow.

## Setting Up Apple Sign-In

### Step 1: Configure Apple Developer

<Steps>
<Step title="Enable Sign in with Apple">

In [Apple Developer](https://developer.apple.com/), go to **Identifiers** and select your App ID.

Enable the **Sign in with Apple** capability.

</Step>

<Step title="Create a Key">

Go to **Keys → Add Key**.

Enable **Sign in with Apple** and configure it for your app.

Register the key and **download it** — you'll need this file.

</Step>

<Step title="Note Your Bundle ID">

Copy your app's **Bundle ID** from the Identifiers section.

</Step>
</Steps>

### Step 2: Configure Supabase

1. In Supabase, go to **Authentication → Providers → Apple**
2. Enable the Apple provider
3. Enter your **Bundle ID** as the Client ID
4. Upload or paste your key file contents
5. Save the configuration

### Step 3: Add to Your App

In MobileCoder, prompt:

> "Add Apple sign-in to the app using Supabase Auth. Use native Sign in with Apple, not a web browser."

<Info>
Specifying "native" ensures the AI uses the iOS Sign in with Apple sheet instead of a web-based flow.
</Info>

---

## Adding Both Providers

To add both Google and Apple sign-in at once:

> "Add sign-in with Google and Apple using Supabase Auth. For Apple, use native Sign in with Apple."

The AI will create a sign-in screen with both options and handle all the authentication logic.

---

## Testing Authentication

### Enable User Signups

In Supabase, go to **Authentication → Settings → User Signups** and make sure new users can sign up.

### Test the Flow

1. Run your app in the preview or on a device
2. Tap the Google or Apple sign-in button
3. Complete the OAuth flow
4. Check Supabase's **Authentication → Users** to see the new user

## Troubleshooting

<AccordionGroup>
  <Accordion icon="globe" title="Google opens Safari and fails">
    Make sure user signups are enabled in Supabase Auth settings. Also verify your redirect URI matches exactly.
  </Accordion>
  <Accordion icon="apple" title="Apple says 'missing OAuth secret'">
    This usually means the flow is using web-based OAuth instead of native. Prompt MobileCoder to "redo Apple sign-in as native only."
  </Accordion>
  <Accordion icon="user-slash" title="User not appearing in Supabase">
    Check if there are any errors in the browser console. Ensure the OAuth providers are correctly configured with valid credentials.
  </Accordion>
</AccordionGroup>
