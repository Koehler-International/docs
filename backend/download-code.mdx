### Continue Development

Once you have the code, you have full control:

- Add new features
- Integrate additional APIs
- Hand it off to another developer
- Use it as a starting point for a larger project

## Code Preservation

Your code is automatically saved in MobileCoder after every AI execution. This means:

- **Always backed up**: Your work is preserved even if you close the browser
- **Sandbox restoration**: If your sandbox expires, it's restored automatically when you return
- **Download anytime**: You can always get the latest version of your code

<Info>
Code is saved after each AI execution. If you're testing in the live preview and haven't run the AI, those preview interactions aren't saved as code changes.
