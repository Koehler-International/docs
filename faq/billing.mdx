## How does the credit system work?

MobileCoder uses a **credit-based system**. When the AI works on your project, it consumes credits based on the complexity of the task.

Credits are included with your subscription plan and reset each billing cycle.

---

## How much does MobileCoder cost?

MobileCoder offers multiple subscription tiers:

- **Free** — Try MobileCoder with limited credits
- **Starter** — For personal projects and learning
- **Pro** — For serious app development
- **Premium** — For power users and professionals

Visit [mobilecoder.ai](https://mobilecoder.ai) for current pricing.

## What happens when I run out of credits?

When your credits are depleted:

1. You'll see a warning in the interface
2. The AI won't be able to make changes until you have more credits
3. You can upgrade your plan immediately for more credits
4. Or wait until your credits reset at the start of your next billing cycle

Your projects and code remain safe — you just can't make AI-powered changes until you have credits.

---

## Can I buy extra credits?

Credits are included in subscription plans. To get more credits, upgrade to a higher tier. Extra credit purchases may be available — check the pricing page for current options.

---

## How do I upgrade my plan?

1. Go to your account settings
2. Click on **Subscription** or **Billing**
3. Select a new plan
4. Complete the checkout

Upgrades take effect immediately, and you'll receive the new credit allocation right away.

## How do I downgrade my plan?

When you downgrade:

1. Go to your account settings
2. Select a lower tier plan
3. The downgrade is **scheduled** for the end of your current billing period

You'll keep your current plan's credits until your next billing date, then switch to the new plan.

## Can I cancel my subscription?

Yes, you can cancel anytime:
