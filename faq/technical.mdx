---

## Are MobileCoder apps actually native iOS/Android apps?

Yes, MobileCoder apps are fully native apps built with **React Native** and powered by **Expo**. They work on both iOS and Android devices and can be published to both app stores.

React Native is the same framework used by Discord, Shopify, Coinbase, Instagram, and nearly 30% of the top 100 apps on the App Store. It's not a web view — it's truly native.

---

## Can I build production-ready apps?

Yes. MobileCoder uses a production-ready tech stack. You can publish simple apps directly to the App Store or Google Play.

For complex features, you can:

- Download your code and continue in Xcode
- Hire a developer to add custom functionality
- Use the exported code as a starting point

---

## Does it work on iOS and Android?

Yes! MobileCoder builds cross-platform apps that work on both iOS and Android from a single codebase. The same project can be published to both the App Store and Google Play Store.

---

## Can I build a web app?

MobileCoder focuses on mobile apps, but Expo apps can also run on the web. After exporting your code, you can deploy the web version to platforms like Vercel or Netlify.

See [Expo's guide on hosting web apps](https://docs.expo.dev/guides/publishing-websites/) for more details.

## What happens when my sandbox expires?

Sandboxes automatically pause after a period of inactivity (typically 20 minutes) to save resources. When you return to your project:

1. The sandbox automatically resumes
2. Your code is restored from GitHub
3. The preview becomes available again

This usually takes just a few seconds. Your code is never lost.

---

## Can I use custom npm packages?

Yes. You can ask MobileCoder to install any npm package:

> "Install the react-native-maps package"

The AI will install the package and integrate it into your project.

<Info>
Some packages with native dependencies may require additional configuration after exporting to Xcode.

## What APIs and services can I integrate?

MobileCoder can integrate with any API that has a REST or GraphQL interface:

- **AI services** — OpenAI, Anthropic, etc.
- **Payment** — Stripe, RevenueCat
- **Analytics** — Mixpanel, Amplitude
- **Maps** — Google Maps, Mapbox
- **Social** — Firebase, Supabase
- **Any REST API** — Weather, stocks, etc.

Just describe what you want to integrate, and the AI will handle the implementation.

## What are the file size limits?

| Content | Limit |
|---------|-------|
| Image attachments | 5MB per image |
| Voice recordings | 25MB per recording |
| Project size | No hard limit |

---

## Can I use TypeScript?

Yes! All MobileCoder projects use **TypeScript** by default. The AI generates type-safe code that catches errors early and provides better IDE support.

---

## What version of Expo does MobileCoder use?

MobileCoder uses **Expo SDK 54+**, which includes the latest features and security updates. Projects are kept up to date with current best practices.

---

## Can I eject from Expo?

After exporting your code, you have full control. You can:

- Run `npx expo prebuild` to generate native projects
- Modify native iOS/Android code directly
- Add native modules not supported by Expo
