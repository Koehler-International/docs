## How does MobileCoder work?

Describe your app idea in plain English and MobileCoder generates a working app using **React Native** and **Expo**. You can test it instantly:

- In the **browser preview** directly on the website
- On your **phone** by scanning a QR code with the Expo Go app

The browser preview is great for quick iterations, but for the most accurate testing, use Expo Go on your physical device.

---

## Do I need coding experience?

No coding experience is required to get started. MobileCoder creates a working prototype in minutes from plain English descriptions.

For more complex apps with features like authentication, databases, or payments, some technical understanding helps — but MobileCoder's AI handles the heavy lifting.

---

## What types of apps can I build?

MobileCoder excels at building:

- **Utility apps** — todo lists, calculators, note-taking apps
- **Content apps** — news readers, recipe apps, portfolios
- **Social apps** — with Supabase integration for backend
- **AI-powered apps** — chat interfaces, image generators
- **E-commerce apps** — product catalogs, shopping carts

MobileCoder apps can store data locally, connect to Supabase for cloud features, and integrate with third-party APIs.

## Can I use MobileCoder for professional purposes?

Yes, you can use MobileCoder for professional purposes. Apps built with MobileCoder can be published to the App Store and Google Play Store.

Many users build:

- Personal projects
- Startup MVPs
- Client prototypes

- Side projects

---

## How is MobileCoder different from other app builders?

MobileCoder stands out with:

- **AI-first approach** — Describe what you want, not how to build it
- **Native apps** — Real React Native apps, not web views
- **Live preview** — See changes instantly as the AI works
- **Voice & image input** — Communicate naturally with the AI
- **Native Supabase integration** — Connect your backend with one click
- **Full code ownership** — Download and continue development anywhere

---

## What tech stack does MobileCoder use?

MobileCoder builds apps with:

- **React Native** — Cross-platform native apps
- **Expo** — Modern development framework
- **TypeScript** — Type-safe code
- **Expo Router** — File-based navigation
- **NativeWind** — Tailwind CSS for React Native
- **Supabase** — Backend as a service (optional)

This is the same stack used by companies like Discord, Shopify, and Coinbase.

---

## Is my data secure?

Yes. MobileCoder takes security seriously:

- Projects are stored in private GitHub repositories
- Supabase connections use OAuth (no API keys stored)
- All data is encrypted in transit
- Sandboxes are isolated and temporary
