## Overview

This guide walks you through publishing your MobileCoder app to the Google Play Store. You'll need to create an AAB (Android App Bundle) file and set up a Google Play Developer account.

## Prerequisites

- **Google Play Developer Account** ($25 one-time fee) — [Sign up here](https://play.google.com/console/)
- **Node.js and npm** installed
- Your MobileCoder project code downloaded
- App icon and screenshots ready

## Step 1: Prepare Your App

### Update App Information

Before building, update your app's configuration in `app.json`:

```json
{
  "expo": {
    "name": "Your App Name",
    "slug": "your-app-slug",
    "android": {
      "package": "com.yourcompany.yourapp",
      "versionCode": 1
    }
  }
}
```

<Info>
The package name must be unique and typically follows the format `com.companyname.appname`. The versionCode must be incremented for each new release.
</Info>

## Step 2: Create APK for Testing

Before publishing, test your app on a physical Android device.

### Generate APK

```bash
# Navigate to your project
cd your-project

# Install dependencies
npm install

# Build APK for testing
npx expo build:android -t apk
```

Or using EAS Build:

```bash
# Install EAS CLI
npm install -g eas-cli

# Configure EAS
eas build:configure

# Build APK
eas build --platform android --profile preview
```

### Install on Device

1. Download the APK file
2. Transfer to your Android device
3. Open the file to install (you may need to enable "Install from unknown sources")
4. Test your app thoroughly

## Step 3: Create AAB for Production

The Google Play Store requires an **AAB (Android App Bundle)** for distribution.

### Generate AAB

```bash
# Using EAS Build (recommended)
eas build --platform android --profile production
```

Or using Expo classic build:

```bash
npx expo build:android -t app-bundle
```

Wait for the build to complete, then download the AAB file.

## Step 4: Set Up Google Play Console

<Steps>
<Step title="Create Developer Account">

Go to [Google Play Console](https://play.google.com/console/) and sign up. There's a one-time $25 registration fee.

</Step>

<Step title="Create New App">

Click **Create app** and fill in:

- App name
- Default language
- App or game
- Free or paid

Accept the declarations and click **Create app**.

</Step>

<Step title="Complete Store Listing">

Fill in all required information:

- **App details**: Description, screenshots, feature graphic
- **Categorization**: Category and tags
- **Contact details**: Email, phone, website

</Step>
</Steps>

## Step 5: Upload and Release

<Steps>
<Step title="Go to Production">

In your app's dashboard, navigate to **Release → Production**.

</Step>

<Step title="Create New Release">

Click **Create new release**.

</Step>

<Step title="Upload AAB">

Drag and drop your AAB file or click to browse.

</Step>

<Step title="Add Release Notes">

Write what's new in this version.

</Step>

<Step title="Review and Roll Out">

Click **Review release**, then **Start rollout to Production**.

</Step>
</Steps>

## Internal Testing (Recommended)

Before a full release, test with a small group:

1. Go to **Release → Testing → Internal testing**
2. Create a new release and upload your AAB
3. Add tester email addresses
4. Testers receive a link to install your app

This is Google's equivalent of TestFlight.
