## Overview

**Expo Launch** is the simplest way to publish your MobileCoder app to the App Store and Google Play Store. It handles all the technical configuration automatically — no Xcode, Android Studio, or prior knowledge needed.

<Info>
Expo Launch guides you through the entire process in your browser. All you need is your code and developer accounts.
</Info>

## Requirements

Before you begin, make sure you have:

- Your MobileCoder project code ([download it first](/publishing/code-export))
- A **GitHub account** (free) — to upload your code
- For iOS: **Apple Developer Account** ($99/year) — [Enroll here](https://developer.apple.com/programs/)
- For Android: **Google Play Developer Account** ($25 one-time) — [Register here](https://play.google.com/console)

## How Expo Launch Works

Expo Launch simplifies the publishing process into 4 steps:

1. **Upload your code** — Push your project to a GitHub repository
2. **Connect to Expo Launch** — Enter your repo URL and let it analyze your app
3. **Configure automatically** — Expo Launch handles signing, certificates, and build settings
4. **Launch** — Your app is built and submitted to the stores

## Step-by-Step Guide

### Step 1: Prepare Your Project

<Steps>
<Step title="Download Your Code">

If you haven't already, download your project from MobileCoder:

1. Open your project in MobileCoder
2. Click the **Download** button in the header
3. Extract the ZIP file

</Step>

<Step title="Update App Configuration">

Before publishing, update your app's configuration in `app.json`:

```json
{
  "expo": {
    "name": "Your App Name",
    "slug": "your-app-slug",
    "version": "1.0.0",
    "ios": {
      "bundleIdentifier": "com.yourcompany.yourapp"
    },
    "android": {
      "package": "com.yourcompany.yourapp"
    }
  }
}
```

<Info>
The bundle identifier/package name must be unique. Use the format `com.companyname.appname`.
</Info>

</Step>

<Step title="Push to GitHub">

Create a new repository on GitHub and push your code:

```bash
cd your-project
git init
git add .
git commit -m "Initial commit"
git branch -M main
git remote add origin https://github.com/yourusername/your-app.git
git push -u origin main
```

</Step>
</Steps>

### Step 2: Launch with Expo

<Steps>
<Step title="Go to Expo Launch">

Visit [launch.expo.dev](https://launch.expo.dev) in your browser.

</Step>

<Step title="Enter Your Repository URL">

Paste your GitHub repository URL and click **Launch**.

</Step>

<Step title="Sign In">

Connect your Expo account (create one if needed — it's free).

</Step>

<Step title="Configure Your App">

Expo Launch will analyze your project and guide you through any required configuration. Most settings are handled automatically.

</Step>

<Step title="Connect Developer Accounts">

For iOS, you'll connect your Apple Developer account. For Android, you'll connect your Google Play Console.

</Step>

<Step title="Launch">

Click Launch and Expo will:
- Build your app in the cloud
- Handle code signing and certificates
- Submit to the app stores

</Step>
</Steps>

## What Expo Launch Handles

| Task | Traditional Way | With Expo Launch |
|------|----------------|------------------|
| Code signing | Manual certificate management | Automatic |
| Provisioning profiles | Download and configure in Xcode | Automatic |
| Build configuration | Edit native project files | Automatic |
| App Store submission | Archive and upload from Xcode | One click |
| Play Store submission | Build APK/AAB, upload to Console | One click |

## After Launch

### iOS Apps

After a successful iOS launch:
- Your app is uploaded to **TestFlight**
- You'll receive an invite to test your own app
- From TestFlight, you can submit to the App Store

### Android Apps

After a successful Android launch:
- Your app is uploaded to **Google Play Console**
- You can release to internal testing or production
- Configure your store listing in the Console

## Publishing to Web

Expo Launch also supports deploying your app as a website:

1. Select **Launch to Web** on the Expo Launch page
2. Your app is deployed using EAS Hosting
3. Get a public URL instantly

<Info>
Web deployment uses the same React Native code — no modifications needed.
</Info>

## Updating Your App

When you're ready to publish an update:

1. Make changes in MobileCoder
2. Download the updated code
3. Push to the same GitHub repository
4. Run Expo Launch again

Your version number will increment automatically.

## Troubleshooting

<AccordionGroup>
  <Accordion icon="code-branch" title="Repository not found">
    Make sure your GitHub repository is public, or connect your GitHub account to Expo.
  </Accordion>
  <Accordion icon="key" title="Apple Developer account issues">
    Ensure you have an active Apple Developer Program membership ($99/year). Free accounts cannot publish to the App Store.
  </Accordion>
  <Accordion icon="android" title="Google Play upload failing">
    Verify your Google Play Developer account is fully set up and you've accepted all agreements.
  </Accordion>
  <Accordion icon="file-code" title="Build errors">
    Check that your `app.json` is valid and all dependencies are correctly installed. Try running `npm install` locally first.
  </Accordion>
  <Accordion icon="certificate" title="Signing certificate issues">
    Expo Launch handles certificates automatically. If you encounter issues, try revoking old certificates in your Apple Developer account.
  </Accordion>
</AccordionGroup>

## Alternative: Traditional Publishing

If you prefer more control, you can still publish traditionally:

- **iOS**: Use Xcode on a Mac ([App Store guide](/publishing/app-store))
- **Android**: Use Android Studio or `eas build` ([Play Store guide](/publishing/google-play))
