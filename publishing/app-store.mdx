## Overview

This guide walks you through publishing your MobileCoder app to the Apple App Store using the traditional Xcode method.

<Info>
**Recommended**: For the easiest publishing experience, use [Expo Launch](/publishing/expo-launch) instead. It handles everything automatically without needing Xcode.
</Info>

## Prerequisites

- A **Mac** computer (Xcode only runs on macOS)
- **Xcode** installed from the App Store
- **Apple Developer Account** ($99/year) — [Enroll here](https://developer.apple.com/programs/)
- Your MobileCoder project code ([downloaded](/publishing/code-export))
- App icon and screenshots ready

## Step 1: Prepare Your App

### Update App Information

Before building, update your app's configuration:

1. Open your project in MobileCoder
2. Update the **app name** and **bundle identifier**
3. Set your **app icon**

Or edit `app.json` directly after downloading:

```json
{
  "expo": {
    "name": "Your App Name",
    "slug": "your-app-slug",
    "ios": {
      "bundleIdentifier": "com.yourcompany.yourapp"
    }
  }
}
```

<Info>
The bundle identifier must be unique and typically follows the format `com.companyname.appname`.
</Info>

### Generate an App Icon

If you don't have an app icon, ask MobileCoder:

> "Generate an app icon for my app."

The AI will create and integrate an appropriate icon.

## Step 2: Create App in App Store Connect
