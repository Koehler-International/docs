## Prompting for Higher-Quality Apps

MobileCoder doesn't just follow instructions — it interprets intent. How you describe the *feel*, *goal*, and *user experience* of your app has a direct impact on build quality.

If you want your app to feel polished, alive, and production-ready, you need to prompt for more than features.

## 1. Define the Experience, Not Just the Features

Instead of only listing what the app should do, explain **how it should feel to use**.

Compare:

**Basic prompt:**

> "Create a fitness app with a dashboard and workouts."

**Better prompt:**

> "Create a fitness app that feels fast, motivating, and modern. The goal is to create the best possible user experience."

When you describe the experience, MobileCoder makes better decisions around layout, spacing, flow, and interaction.

## 2. Tell MobileCoder When Polish Matters

If you don't ask for polish, MobileCoder will prioritize functionality. If you want a higher-production feel, say so explicitly.

Examples:

- "This should feel high-production and polished."
- "Make the app feel alive and responsive."
- "Prioritize smooth interactions over adding more features."

These signals encourage:

- Better screen transitions
- More thoughtful spacing and hierarchy
- Cleaner, more intentional UI decisions

## 3. Ask for Transitions and Motion

Animation and transitions can be a major part of perceived quality. Making an app feel alive versus static could be the difference between a good user experience and a bad one.

Good prompts:

> "Add subtle transition animations between screens."

> "Buttons should feel responsive when tapped."

> "Use smooth page transitions to make the app feel alive."

Even simple motion dramatically improves how finished an app feels.

## 4. Describe the Mood and Target User

UI improves significantly when MobileCoder knows **who the app is for** and **what mood it should convey**.

Examples:

- "Target user: busy professionals who want clarity and speed."
- "Mood: calm, minimal, and focused."
- "Design for Gen-Z — bold, modern, and energetic."

This helps MobileCoder make better decisions about:

- Color usage
- Typography
- Spacing and density
- Overall visual tone

## 5. State the Primary Goal Clearly

Always tell MobileCoder what matters most.

Examples:

- "The main goal is the best possible user experience."
- "Optimize for simplicity and clarity."
- "Reduce friction as much as possible."

When goals conflict, MobileCoder will prioritize the one you state.

## 6. Combine Intent With Constraints

High-quality prompts balance **vision + boundaries**.

Example:

> "Create a calm, high-production app focused on user experience. Keep it simple. One main flow. No extra features."

This leads to cleaner, more intentional builds.
